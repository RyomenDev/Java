Java is **primarily used for backend development**, but it can also be used in some frontend contexts‚Äîthough that's less common today. Here's a breakdown:

## üîß Java in Backend

- **Web applications** using frameworks like:

  - **Spring Boot** (most popular for REST APIs and microservices)
  - **Java EE / Jakarta EE**

- **Enterprise applications:** Banking, healthcare, and government systems.
- **Android app backend** when combined with tools like Firebase or custom APIs.
- **Database access** via JDBC, JPA, or Hibernate.
- **API development** (e.g., RESTful APIs).

## üé® Java in Frontend (Rare Today)

- **JavaFX:** Used for building desktop GUI apps (JavaFX is still supported but niche).
- **Swing:** Older GUI toolkit, mostly outdated.
- **Applet (Deprecated):** Used in browsers, now obsolete due to security issues and modern web standards.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
For **web frontend**, Java is not commonly used today. Technologies like **HTML, CSS, JavaScript,** and frameworks like **React, Vue, or Angular** are the standard.
